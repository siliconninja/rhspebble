[Description]

View your RHS schedule and information in a convenient
location.

Check the current rotating schedule day, time until the period ends, 
which teachers are absent, the weather at the school, and more.

It's free and doesn't eat up your phone's data or battery life. It does 
not run in the background.

The app is open-source and gets data from reliable resources. Click on 
"Source Code" below to check it out!


COMPATIBILITY:
This app works on Pebble Classic/Pebble Steel, Pebble Time, and Pebble 
Time Round watches! You can download older versions of the app on the 
"Source Code" page linked below if needed.

NOTIFICATIONS:
This app pushes timeline pins by period. These timeline pins do not send
notifications, they are only shown for reference.

DEVELOPERS:
Data ported over from the RHS iOS app website: 
http://bit.ly/rhsdata

Weather data provided by:
http://forecast.io/

PRIVACY:
This app DOES NOT collect personal information or any specific 
information about your watch. It will not use them to track your habits 
or record specific keystrokes.
However, this app will collect crash data, launches, total button 
presses and other general information to improve the application's 
stability, not to track any individual.

This feature cannot be turned off due to Pebble's data collection 
feature being activated when installed from the Pebble app store. You 
may always install the current version or older versions from the 
"Source Code" link below. Just click on the "VERSIONS" folder and select
a version to install (open the file in the Pebble app).
